\section{Performance considerations}
\label{sec:performance}

Performance is an integral aspect of any application and as such Roslyn doesn't escape from it either. It's not just about compiling an assembly as fast as possible: that's just one of the use cases in which Roslyn is used. Think about other scenarios such as getting quick \gls{intellisense}\footnote{Intellisense: context-aware hints as you type} or fluent syntax highlighting of text as you scroll but also affects other performance aspects such as the memory impact.

In this section we will look at a handful of techniques the Roslyn team uses to optimize the platform. These are general approaches that often apply their ideas in several areas of the codebase, sometimes through a common resource. This should indicate that these are often optimizations at a high level rather than very specific single-use optimizations.
